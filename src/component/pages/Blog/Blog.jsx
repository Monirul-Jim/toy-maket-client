            <h1 className='text-3xl text-black font-semibold'>1)What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?
            </h1>
            <p className='text-slate-500'>An access token is a credential that represents the authorization granted to a client application to access protected resources on behalf of a user. It is typically short-lived and is used to authenticate API requests. A refresh token, on the other hand, is a long-lived credential used to obtain new access tokens when the original one expires.
                Both tokens should be securely stored on the client-side. The access token can be stored in memory or a short-lived storage mechanism like browser cookies, while the refresh token should be securely stored, preferably in an encrypted format, in a persistent storage like a secure cookie or local storage. It is essential to protect these tokens from unauthorized access to prevent security breaches.</p>
            <h1 className='text-3xl text-black  font-semibold'>2) Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h1>
            <p className='text-slate-500'>SQL and NoSQL databases differ in their data models and query languages. SQL databases are structured and use a fixed schema to organize data into tables, enforcing strong consistency and supporting complex joins and transactions. They are suitable for structured data and relational queries. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, offer flexible schemas and use various data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph. They prioritize scalability, high performance, and horizontal scaling. NoSQL databases are ideal for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, and they sacrifice some consistency guarantees for increased scalability and speed. The choice between the two depends on specific application requirements and scalability needs.</p>

            <h1 className='text-3xl text-black  font-semibold'>3) What is express js? What is Next JS ? </h1>
            <p className='text-slate-500'>Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the creation of web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for handling HTTP requests and responses, managing routes, and handling middleware. Express.js allows developers to build scalable and flexible server-side applications using JavaScript.
                Next.js, on the other hand, is a React framework that focuses on server-side rendering and provides an opinionated structure for building web applications. It combines React with server-side rendering capabilities, enabling faster initial page loads and improved SEO. Next.js offers features like automatic code splitting, hot module replacement, and static site generation. It simplifies the development process by providing a ready-to-use setup, routing system, and efficient build optimization, allowing developers to create high-performance web applications with ease.</p>

            <h1 className='text-3xl text-black  font-semibold'>4) What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ? </h1>
            <p className='text-slate-500 mb-4'>MongoDB's aggregate is a framework for performing advanced data analysis and transformation operations on collections of documents in MongoDB. It provides a flexible and powerful way to process data by using a pipeline of stages. Each stage performs a specific operation on the input documents, and the results are passed to the next stage.
                The aggregate pipeline consists of multiple stages, such as filtering, grouping, projecting, sorting, and aggregating data. Each stage applies an operation to the input documents and generates an output for the subsequent stage. This allows for complex data manipulations, including combining multiple documents, computing new fields, grouping data based on specific criteria, and performing calculations on grouped data.
                By using the aggregate framework, developers can efficiently query and analyze data in MongoDB, transforming it in meaningful ways to meet their specific requirements.</p>
